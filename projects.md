Mouse over or click on the tiles below to learn more about some interesting stuff I've been up to.

* [CSB Course Flowchart](/csb_flowchart), an interactive, graphical representation of the required
  courses for Lehigh CSB majors.
* [NJTransit Simulation](/stop_map), overlay a map of NJ with the locations of trains thoughout the
  day.
* [Historical photos](/basking_ride_photos) Recreate historical photos of my
  hometown and create a before and after viewer.

Firefox Extensions
---------------

A lot of these Firefox extensions and
[Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) user scripts are showing their age
but I'm still receiving praise about them from my users so they live on:

* Click Steer is a Firefox extension that mimics Opera's ability to navigate
  backwards and forwards in your history by quickly pressing the left and right
  mouse buttons in sequence. Press the right mouse button and then the left
  mouse button to go back, left first to go forwards.
* RDoctor is a user script that enables searching by file, class, and method on
  Ruby RDoc standard template pages.
* F.I.G.S. (the Facebook Interactive Group Searcher) is another user script
  that allows Facebook users to search through their groups as easily as they
  do through their friends by adding groups to the AJAX search results on the
  box. I believe Facebook has now implemented this functionality.
