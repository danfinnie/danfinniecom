Firefox Extensions
---------------

A lot of these Firefox extensions and
[Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) user scripts are showing their age
but I'm still receiving praise about them from my users so they live on:

* [Click Steer](/public/downloads/click-steer.xpi) is a Firefox extension that mimics
  Opera's ability to navigate backwards and forwards in your history by quickly
  pressing the left and right mouse buttons in sequence. Press the right mouse
  button and then the left mouse button to go back, left first to go forwards.
* [RDoctor](/public/downloads/rdoctor-version-1.user.js) is a user script that enables
  searching by file, class, and method on Ruby RDoc standard template pages.
* [F.I.G.S.](/public/downloads/fig-v-2.user.js) (the Facebook Interactive Group
  Searcher) is another user script that allows Facebook users to search through
  their groups as easily as they do through their friends by adding groups to
  the AJAX search results on the box. I believe Facebook has now implemented
  this functionality.
