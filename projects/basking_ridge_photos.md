title: Historic Basking Ridge Photos
---

My hometown of Basking Ridge, NJ has a surprising amount of recorded history.
The [Historical Society of the Somerset
Hills](http://www.historicalsocietyofsomersethills.org/index2.php) collected a
lot of historical photos and [posted them
online](http://www.historicalsocietyofsomersethills.org/Images/photoarchive/phpslideshow.php?directory=photos).
My friend Zack Nacheman and I took it upon ourselves to recreate these
historical photos and create a "before and after" gallery.  Check it out below
by mousing over the historic photo to see the modern day version!  We are
especially proud of the <a href="#loupify4">picture with a fire brigade in
front of a 600-year-old oak tree that George Washington slept under</a> because
we got a modern firetruck to pose in the same spot!
